cmd : the command that was run during playbook to generate output
stdout : the output of command
stderr: the error output of the command
start: the time and date when the command started execution
end: the date and time when the command ended executing
delta: time taken for the execution of commands
stdout_lines: an array containing the output of command i.e., the output lines are seperated using new lines
stderr_lines: an array containing the errors of the command seperated by new lines


ex: in the above playbook if we replace "mypass" variable with "mypass.stdout" then the playbook will show the output directly.
